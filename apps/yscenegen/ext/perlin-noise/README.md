Various versions of Perlin noise

This is a collection of various files I have been sprinkling around
the Internet for a couple of decades. It was about time I collected
them in a proper repository.

The functions are in plain C, but the code is very straightforward,
comsisting solely of plain computational sequences. Porting to C++
is only a matter of encapsulating this in classes, and porting to
any other language should be a reasonably easy as well.

Because of time constraints, I will not maintain separate language
versions in this public repository, and I hope for your understanding.
